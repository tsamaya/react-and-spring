# React.js and Spring REST

This is a sample [springboot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) application using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). The source code is coming from this tutorial:
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/.

While the tutorial is using maven and a front-end plugin to build the react bundle file, this repository project is built with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [gradle](https://gradle.com).

This repository is also adding a [Jenkins pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) to build the project.
